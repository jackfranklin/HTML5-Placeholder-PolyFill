#HTML5 Placeholder PolyFill
Firstly, I know this is nothing new and I'm sure a lot of other people have written this kind of script before, but I wrote this a while back and finally got round to chucking it on Github, much for my sake as well as anyone else's.

#Usage
Just give fields the placeholder attribute. In browsers that support HTML5's placeholders, this script does nothing. In browsers that do support it, it mimics support. You need to do nothing else.

#Suggestions?
